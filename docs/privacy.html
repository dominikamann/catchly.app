    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 2, 2026</p>

    <h2>General Note and Mandatory Information</h2>
    <p>The responsible body for the data processing of this app is:</p>

    <h2>Revocation of Your Consent</h2>
    <p>Some data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke your consent at any time. An informal message is sufficient. The legality of the processing until revocation remains unaffected.</p>

    <h2>Right to Lodge a Complaint</h2>

The competent authority is the state data protection officer of the federal state in which our company is based.

    <h2>Right to Data Portability</h2>
    <p>You have the right to receive data we process automatically based on your consent or in fulfillment of a contract, in a machine-readable format. Direct transfer to another responsible party is possible if technically feasible.</p>

    <h2>Right to Information, Correction, Blocking, Deletion</h2>
    <p>You have the right to free information about your stored personal data, its origin, recipients, and purpose. You can request correction, blocking, or deletion at any time under applicable law.

    <h2>Contact Form</h2>
    <p>Data transmitted via the contact form will be stored, including your contact details, to process your request or for follow-up questions. This data will not be shared without your consent. Processing is based exclusively on your consent (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR). You can revoke consent at any time. Data will remain stored until you request deletion or revoke consent, unless mandatory legal retention periods apply.</p>

    <h2>App Data</h2>
    <p>Catchly does not share any user data with third parties. The app only uses data necessary for operation via Apple App Store services (e.g., app analytics, crash reporting), as provided by Apple, and does not transfer personal information to us or any other party.</p>

    <h2>Weather Data (OpenWeatherMap)</h2>
    <p>The app uses the <strong>OpenWeatherMap</strong> service to display weather data at your fishing locations. The following data is transmitted to OpenWeatherMap:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) of your selected locations</li>
        <li>Timestamps for historical weather queries (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is used exclusively to provide current and historical weather information. OpenWeatherMap processes this data according to their own privacy policy. For more information, see: <a href="https://openweather.co.uk/privacy-policy" target="_blank">OpenWeatherMap Privacy Policy</a></p>
    <p>Legal basis: Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR (legitimate interest in providing weather data for anglers).</p>
