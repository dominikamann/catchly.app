    <h1>Privacy Policy - Catchly</h1>

    <p>Effective Date: 2025</p>

    <h2>General Note and Mandatory Information</h2>
    <p>The responsible body for the data processing of this app is:</p>
    <p><strong>Dominik Amann<br>
    Propst-Kügelin-Str. 12<br>
    88339 Bad Waldsee<br>
    Germany</strong></p>
    <p>The responsible body decides alone or together with others on the purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g., names, contact details, etc.).</p>

    <h2>Revocation of Your Consent</h2>
    <p>Some data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke your consent at any time. An informal message is sufficient. The legality of the processing until revocation remains unaffected.</p>

    <h2>Right to Lodge a Complaint</h2>
    <p>You have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority in the event of a breach of data protection law. The competent authority is the state data protection officer of the federal state in which our company is based. See: <a href="https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Anschriften_Links/anschriften_links-node.html" target="_blank">List of Data Protection Officers</a></p>

    <h2>Right to Data Portability</h2>
    <p>You have the right to receive data we process automatically based on your consent or in fulfillment of a contract, in a machine-readable format. Direct transfer to another responsible party is possible if technically feasible.</p>

    <h2>Right to Information, Correction, Blocking, Deletion</h2>
    <p>You have the right to free information about your stored personal data, its origin, recipients, and purpose. You can request correction, blocking, or deletion at any time under applicable law. Feel free to contact us here: <a href="https://github.com/dominikamann/catchly.app/discussions" target="_blank">GitHub Discussions</a> or via email at <span id="email-privacy"></span>.</p>

    <h2>Contact Form</h2>
    <p>Data transmitted via the contact form will be stored, including your contact details, to process your request or for follow-up questions. This data will not be shared without your consent. Processing is based exclusively on your consent (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR). You can revoke consent at any time. Data will remain stored until you request deletion or revoke consent, unless mandatory legal retention periods apply.</p>

    <h2>App Data</h2>
    <p>Catchly does not share any user data with third parties. The app only uses data necessary for operation via Apple App Store services (e.g., app analytics, crash reporting), as provided by Apple, and does not transfer personal information to us or any other party.</p>
